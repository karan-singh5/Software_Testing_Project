Automated Web Testing with Selenium &amp; TestNG

⚡ In this project, I automated web application testing using <b>Selenium</b> WebDriver and <b>Java</b>. I developed test scripts to simulate user interactions in the <b>Chrome browser</b> and integrated <b>TestNG</b> for managing test cases and     generating detailed HTML reports. Additionally, I created <b>Excel reports</b> to log test case results, track execution status, and highlight any defects.

  The use of <b>IntelliJ IDEA</b> provided an efficient development environment, while automating repetitive tasks enhanced testing speed and accuracy, ensuring high software quality and faster feedback during development cycles.
